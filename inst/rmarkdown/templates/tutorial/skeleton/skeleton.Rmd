You can write some text appearing in both pdf files using the standard [markup language](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

Use the `r` chunk to display some code in both files.

```{r}
head(cars)
```

Use the `r` chunk with ``echo=`solution`, eval = `solution` `` (surrounded by backticks) to display and evaluate the chunk only in the solution pdf.

```{r, echo = `solution`, eval = `solution`}
# Only visible and evaluated in the solution file...
plot(cars)
```

You can also add some explanation text in latex in the customized solution engine (similar to the asis engine)

```{solution}
This is the text explaining how to obtain the solution and written in \LaTeX.
```
