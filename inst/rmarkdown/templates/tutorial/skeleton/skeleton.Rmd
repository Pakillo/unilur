You can write some text appearing in both pdf files using the standard [markup language](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

Use the `r` chunk to display some code in both files.

```{r}
head(cars)
```

Use the `r` chunk with `solution = TRUE` to display and evaluate the chunk only in the solution pdf.

```{r, solution = TRUE}
# Only visible and evaluated in the solution file...
plot(cars)
```

You can also add some explanation text in latex using the asis engine together with `solution = TRUE`

```{asis, solution = TRUE}
This is the text explaining how to obtain the solution and written in \LaTeX.
```

To decide which pdf should be generated you can specify the `solution` option in the yaml header:

-------------------------------------------------------------
     yaml header Pdf creation
      `solution`
---------------- --------------------------------------------
   `yes`         with the solution chunks

   `no`          without the solution chunks
   
   `wwo`         with and without the solution chunks
                 and showing the pdf with solutions

   `wow`         with and without the solution chunks
                 and showing the pdf without solutions
-------------------------------------------------------------
